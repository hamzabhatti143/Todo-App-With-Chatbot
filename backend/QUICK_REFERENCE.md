### Task Reference
You can reference tasks by:
- **Title**: "the groceries task"
- **Keywords**: "the report"
- **First words**: "the buy milk task"

### Fuzzy Matching
TodoBot finds tasks even if you don't use the exact title:
- Task: "Buy groceries from Whole Foods"
- Matches: "groceries", "Whole Foods", "buy groceries"

### Workflow
1. **List tasks** first to see what you have
2. **Reference** tasks by distinctive parts of their title
3. **Confirm** operations completed successfully

## 📝 Common Patterns

### Daily Workflow
```
Morning:  "Show pending tasks"
During:   "Mark [task] as done" (as you complete)
Evening:  "Show what I accomplished today"
```

### Adding with Details
```
"Add [title] with description: [details]"
"Create task: [title], details: [description]"
```
